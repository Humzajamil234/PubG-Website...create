        PUBG Mobile is a good port from what PUBG offers on Xbox One and PC. The smart use of the touchscreen and its
        freemium economic model fit really well and make this game an absolute must-have on any mobile device.
        While you can wander off on your own to get supplies and take out enemies, I found it best to stay close to my
        team. Being a total noob, I had terrible aim, slow reaction times, and lacked knowledge of the game’s overall
        mechanics.

        From what I’ve seen, a handful of players would gather in a circle, stare down at their phones for about 30
        minutes, and yell profanities at what I assumed was at each other.

        Parachuting into the battlefield myself though, I found out that the four-player team-based game was actually
        quite supportive and collaborative.

        The game reminds me of The Hunger Games, but because PUBG is team-based, it’s in your best interest to keep each
        other alive in order to survive yourself.
